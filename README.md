Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard
Project Description
The Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard is an interactive web application that visualizes data on bacterial species found in human navels. This project aims to explore the diversity of bacteria in different individuals, providing insights into the microbiome present in belly buttons.

A well-crafted README description is crucial as it showcases your work to other developers and potential employers. A good README explains what your application does, why you used the technologies you used, the challenges you faced, and future features you hope to implement.

Key Features
Visualizes the top 10 bacterial species found in each sample.
Interactive Bubble and Bar Charts displaying sample data.
Dynamic metadata panel showing demographic information.
Technologies Used
D3.js: For data manipulation and dynamic content rendering.
Plotly.js: For creating interactive and responsive charts.
Bootstrap: For a responsive and modern web layout.
HTML/CSS: For structuring and styling the web page.
Challenges and Future Enhancements
Ensuring the charts dynamically update with user input was a key challenge.
Future enhancements include adding more advanced filtering options and integrating additional datasets.
